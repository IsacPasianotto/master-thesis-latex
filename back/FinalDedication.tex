Research is a journey that is never walked alone.
My journey has been filled with the support of many people, without whom I would
not have been able to reach the end.

First and foremost, my gratitude goes to my supervisor, Prof.~Ruggero Lot, for
his guidance and support throughout my research work and his willingness to
share his knowledge and expertise, always spurring me to improve more.

I am deeply grateful to the co-supervisor of this thesis, Prof.~Stefano Cozzini,
for infecting me with his passion for the parallel computing world.
His course has been a turning point in my academic career. I am grateful for his
support and for the opportunity to work with him and draw from his well of
knowledge.

My gratitude goes also to all the members of the ``Laboratory of Data
Engineering'' (LADE) research group from the RIT institute (``Istituto Ricerca e
Innovzione Tecnologica'') at AREA Science Park, for the stimulating environment, the
fruitful discussions, and the opportunity to work with them first as an intern
and then for this thesis.

No less important was the support of my family and the beloved ones in my life,
who have always been there for me, supporting me in every moment of my life.

I would like to thank my parents, Raffaele and Tamara, for their love and
support, for all their sacrifices to give me the best education possible, and
for always believing in me.

I would like to thank my girlfriend, Arianna, for her love and patience
especially in the most stressful moments of my life, for always being there for
me and trusting my abilities even when I did not.

My gratitude also goes to my friends, starting from the ``\emph{C5}'' group,
which has been my companion in this master journey, making it unforgettable,
especially for the countless study breaks and the moments of relaxation spent
together.

The same goes for all my old friends, who have always fostered our friendship
despite the distance imposed by our different paths and the time that has
passed.

I would also like to thank Trieste, ``città del caffè'', for hosting me during
these years and never letting me go without a good coffee during my moments of
rest from my studies.

Finally, I would like to thank all the people who have been part of my life
during this journey, even if only for a short time, for the support and the
friendship they have given me.
